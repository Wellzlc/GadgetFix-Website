# Security & SEO Audit Completion Report
**Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security & SEO Specialist  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - COMPLETED ✓

## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and remediated **CRITICAL schema markup conflicts** causing Google Search Console errors. The website was injecting aggregateRating schema THREE times on every page, creating duplicate structured data that was harming SEO performance. All issues have been resolved and prevention measures implemented.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Triple AggregateRating Injection
**Problem:** Every page loaded 3 conflicting aggregateRating schemas
**Solution:** 
- Removed aggregateRating from Layout.astro (was on lines 256-262)
- Deleted outdated schema.js file completely
- Kept page-specific ratings only on services.astro and networking-cabling.astro

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Outdated Schema Content
**Problem:** schema.js contained phone repair services and old phone number
**Solution:** Deleted entire schema.js file - it was outdated and redundant

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Schema Duplication
**Problem:** Deferred JavaScript loading created duplicate business entities
**Solution:** Removed `<script src="/js/schema.js" defer></script>` from Layout.astro line 154
