            <h3>What warranty do you offer?</h3>
            <p>All repairs come with our 90-day warranty covering parts and labor. If you experience any issues 
            with the repaired component within 90 days, we'll fix it free of charge. The warranty covers defects

            We recommend backing up your device before any repair as a precaution.</p>
