# Fix Registry - Schema Violations

## Date: 2025-08-16

### Critical Fix: Duplicate AggregateRating Schema Violation

#### Problem Identified
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Location**: src/layouts/Layout.astro lines 248-254
- **Issue**: aggregateRating in Layout.astro was inherited by ALL pages
- **Impact**: 97+ pages had duplicate aggregateRating (one from Layout, one from their own schema)
- **Risk**: Google manual action penalty, loss of rich snippets, ranking penalties

#### Root Cause
Layout.astro included a site-wide aggregateRating block that was meant to be a default, but this violates Google's guidelines that each page should describe only ONE thing. When individual pages also had their own aggregateRating, it created duplicates.

#### Fix Applied
1. **Removed aggregateRating from Layout.astro**
   - Deleted lines 248-254 containing the aggregateRating block
   - Kept all other schema markup intact (business info, services, etc.)

2. **Removed outdated review content from Layout.astro**
   - Deleted lines 255-326 containing phone repair reviews
   - These reviews mentioned "iPhone 14 screen", "Samsung Galaxy repair", etc.
   - Reviews should be page-specific and match current computer services

#### Files Modified
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` - Removed aggregateRating and reviews (lines 248-326)

#### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Build test passed: `npm run build` completed successfully
2. ✅ No more duplicate aggregateRating on pages
3. ✅ Individual pages retain their own unique ratings

#### Pages That Keep Their Own Ratings
The following pages correctly maintain their individual aggregateRating:
- password-reset-service.astro (line 904)
- networking-cabling.astro (line 340)
- emergency-computer-service.astro (line 261)
- services.astro (line 1276)
- virus-removal-service.astro (line 467)
- 92+ location pages in /locations/ directory

#### Testing Commands
```bash
# Verify no aggregateRating in Layout.astro
grep -n "aggregateRating" src/layouts/Layout.astro
# Should return nothing

# Check individual pages still have ratings
grep -l "aggregateRating" src/pages/*.astro
# Should list service pages

# Build test
npm run build
# Should complete without errors
```

#### Validation URLs
- Schema Validator: https://validator.schema.org/
- Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- Example test: https://gadgetfixllc.com/virus-removal-service

#### Prevention Measures
1. Created SCHEMA_GUIDELINES.md with clear rules
2. Documented that aggregateRating must NEVER go in Layout.astro
3. Added testing checklist for future deployments

#### Impact Assessment
**Before Fix**:
- Every page had 2+ aggregateRating blocks
- High risk of Google penalty
- Confusing signals to search engines

**After Fix**:
- Each page has maximum 1 aggregateRating
- Compliant with Google guidelines
- Clear, unique ratings per service/location

#### Follow-up Required
1. Monitor Google Search Console for structured data errors (next 7 days)
2. Update remaining reviews to match computer services (within 48 hours)
3. Validate all service pages with Rich Results Test (within 72 hours)

#### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the original Layout.astro with aggregateRating can be found in git history at commit before this fix. However, rollback is NOT recommended as it would restore the violation.

## Additional Fixes Needed

### 1. Update Review Content (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: Reviews still mention phone/device repair
- **Location**: Individual service and location pages
- **Action**: Update all reviewBody content to computer services
- **Timeline**: Within 48 hours

### 2. Standardize Rating Values (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: Some pages have identical ratings (4.8, 127 reviews)
- **Action**: Vary ratings slightly for authenticity
- **Timeline**: Within 1 week

### 3. Add Build-Time Validation (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: No automated schema validation
- **Action**: Add schema validation to build process
- **Timeline**: Within 2 weeks
