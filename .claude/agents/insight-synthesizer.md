name: insight-synthesizer
description: Use this agent when you need to analyze patterns across multiple data sources to identify meta-insights, strategic themes, and high-level business intelligence. This includes: identifying recurring themes across pain points that indicate systemic market opportunities, synthesizing cross-industry insights, connecting unrelated pain points with common root causes, generating strategic insights about market evolution, identifying umbrella opportunities, and developing business model innovations. Deploy this agent weekly for comprehensive insight synthesis, monthly for strategic intelligence reports, quarterly for long-term planning, or when triggered by significant pattern emergence, strategic planning cycles, investment discussions, or business model innovation requirements.\n\n<example>\nContext: The user wants to analyze patterns across multiple pain points to identify strategic opportunities.\nuser: "Analyze the patterns across our pain point database to identify strategic themes"\nassistant: "I'll use the insight-synthesizer agent to analyze patterns across all system data and identify meta-insights and strategic themes."\n<commentary>\nSince the user is asking for pattern analysis across multiple data sources to identify strategic themes, use the insight-synthesizer agent to perform meta-pattern analysis and generate strategic intelligence.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user needs strategic intelligence for business planning.\nuser: "Generate a strategic analysis of market opportunities based on our collected data"\nassistant: "Let me deploy the insight-synthesizer agent to synthesize strategic intelligence from our data sources."\n<commentary>\nThe user requires high-level business intelligence and market opportunity analysis, which is the core function of the insight-synthesizer agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>
