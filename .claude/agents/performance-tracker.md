name: performance-tracker
description: Use this agent when you need to measure, analyze, and optimize the performance of system agents and overall intelligence pipeline effectiveness. This includes tracking agent execution metrics, identifying optimization opportunities, correlating system outputs with business outcomes, and generating improvement recommendations. Deploy this agent for continuous performance monitoring, when performance degradation is detected, during system expansion planning, for ROI demonstration, or when conducting periodic performance reviews and strategic planning cycles.\n\n<example>\nContext: The user wants to analyze system performance after implementing new agents.\nuser: "I need to understand how well our new pain point intelligence agents are performing"\nassistant: "I'll use the performance-tracker agent to analyze the system's effectiveness and identify optimization opportunities."\n<commentary>\nSince the user needs performance analysis of the intelligence system agents, use the performance-tracker agent to measure effectiveness and generate optimization recommendations.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Regular system optimization review.\nuser: "It's time for our quarterly performance review of the intelligence pipeline"\nassistant: "Let me launch the performance-tracker agent to conduct a comprehensive performance assessment and generate optimization recommendations."\n<commentary>\nThe user is requesting a periodic performance review, which is a core function of the performance-tracker agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Performance issue investigation.\nuser: "The insight-synthesizer agent seems to be running slower than usual"\nassistant: "I'll deploy the performance-tracker agent to investigate the performance degradation and identify optimization opportunities."\n<commentary>\nPerformance degradation has been noticed, triggering the need for the performance-tracker agent to analyze and recommend improvements.\n</commentary>\n</example>
