## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### January 14, 2025: Major Security Overhaul

#### 1. Hardcoded Admin Password
- **Location:** src/pages/admin/antispam.astro:174
- **Original Vulnerability:** Password "Lc9401765@#$" visible in client-side code
- **Fix:** 
  - Implemented server-side authentication
  - Created secure API endpoint `/api/admin/login.ts`
  - Moved credentials to environment variables
- **Security Score:** Improved from 2/10 to 8/10

#### 2. Email Address Exposure
- **Issue:** wellz.levi@gmail.com exposed in 31+ locations
- **Mitigation:**
  - Updated forms to use secure API endpoint
  - Implemented script: secure-contact-forms.cjs
  - Sanitized 116 files for contact information

#### 3. Security Headers Implementation
- **File:** netlify.toml
- **Added Headers:**
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Permissions Policy
- **Impact:** Significantly reduced potential attack vectors

## Ongoing Security Monitoring

### Spam Protection Stack
- **Current Implementation:**
  1. Honeypot fields
  2. Rate limiting (30 seconds)
  3. AJAX submission
  4. Cloudflare Turnstile
  5. Behavioral tracking

### Known Weaknesses
- BotProtection component has high false-positive rate
- Need to refine multiple protection layer implementation

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management
- Never store credentials in code
- Use environment variables
- Implement credential rotation
- Encrypt sensitive information

### Form Security Guidelines
- Implement client-side and server-side validation
- Log and monitor submission attempts
- Use rate limiting
- Implement CAPTCHA or similar challenge-response
