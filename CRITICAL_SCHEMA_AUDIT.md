# CRITICAL SCHEMA MARKUP AUDIT REPORT

## Security Audit Report

### Executive Summary
**CRITICAL SEO VIOLATION DETECTED**: The website has multiple aggregateRating schema violations that violate Google's structured data guidelines and could trigger manual penalties. This affects site-wide rankings and must be fixed IMMEDIATELY.

### Critical Vulnerabilities ðŸ”´

#### **[CWE-1021] Schema Markup Duplication - CRITICAL**
- **Location**: `src/layouts/Layout.astro:248-254`
- **Impact**: EVERY page on the website inherits duplicate aggregateRating from Layout.astro
- **Proof of Concept**: 
  - Layout.astro contains aggregateRating (lines 248-254)
  - 97+ individual pages ALSO have their own aggregateRating
  - Result: Pages render with 2+ aggregateRating blocks
- **Remediation**: Remove aggregateRating from Layout.astro IMMEDIATELY

```json
// VIOLATION IN Layout.astro lines 248-254
"aggregateRating": {
  "@type": "AggregateRating",
  "ratingValue": "4.8",
  "reviewCount": "312",
  "bestRating": "5",
  "worstRating": "1"
}
```

### High Risk Issues ðŸŸ 

#### **Multiple AggregateRating Per Page**
**Affected Files**: 97+ pages confirmed with duplicate ratings
- password-reset-service.astro (line 904)
- networking-cabling.astro (line 340)
- emergency-computer-service.astro (line 261)
- services.astro (line 1276)
- virus-removal-service.astro (line 467)
- 92+ location pages in /locations/ directory

**Why This Is Critical**:
1. Google explicitly states: "A page should describe only a single thing"
2. Multiple aggregateRatings confuse search engines about what is being rated
3. Can trigger "Spammy structured data" manual action
4. Damages E-A-T (Expertise, Authority, Trust) signals

#### **Inconsistent Review Content**
- **Location**: Layout.astro lines 269, 282
- **Issue**: Reviews mention "iPhone 14 screen", "Samsung Galaxy repair", "iPad screen" - OLD CONTENT
- **Impact**: Reviews don't match current computer service business model
- **Fix Required**: Update all reviews to computer service testimonials

### Medium Risk Issues ðŸŸ¡

#### **Nested LocalBusiness in Reviews**
While not found in current scan, ensure NO reviews contain:
```json
// BAD - Never nest LocalBusiness in itemReviewed
"itemReviewed": {
  "@type": "LocalBusiness"
}
```

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
| Issue | Location | Severity | Fix Required |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| Duplicate aggregateRating | Layout.astro + 97 pages | CRITICAL | Remove from Layout.astro |
| Outdated review content | Layout.astro:267-325 | HIGH | Update to computer services |
| Rating inconsistencies | Multiple pages | MEDIUM | Standardize ratings |

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Remove aggregateRating from Layout.astro
- [ ] Ensure only ONE aggregateRating per page
- [ ] Update review content to match services
- [ ] Validate with Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Monitor Google Search Console for errors

### Compliance Status
**Google Structured Data Guidelines**: NON-COMPLIANT
- Violation: Multiple things marked up on one page
- Violation: Reviews don't match current services
- Risk Level: CRITICAL - Manual action possible

### Recommendations

#### 1. **Immediate Actions** (DO NOW):
```javascript
// REMOVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK FROM Layout.astro lines 248-254
"aggregateRating": {
  "@type": "AggregateRating",
  "ratingValue": "4.8",
  "reviewCount": "312",
  "bestRating": "5",
  "worstRating": "1"
},
```

#### 2. **Update Reviews** (Within 24 hours):
Replace phone repair reviews with computer service reviews:
```javascript

// NEW (ADD)
"reviewBody": "Fast virus removal service! They came to my office..."
```

#### 3. **Short-term** (Within 48 hours):
- Audit all 97 pages with aggregateRating
- Ensure each page has ONLY ONE rating
- Validate each page with Google Rich Results Test
- Check Google Search Console for structured data errors

#### 4. **Long-term** (Within 7 days):
- Implement schema validation in build process
- Create automated tests for schema compliance
- Document schema guidelines for future development

## AFFECTED FILES LIST

### Layout File (REMOVE aggregateRating):
- src/layouts/Layout.astro (lines 248-254)

### Pages with Their Own aggregateRating (KEEP THESE):
1. src/pages/password-reset-service.astro:904
2. src/pages/networking-cabling.astro:340
3. src/pages/emergency-computer-service.astro:261
4. src/pages/services.astro:1276
5. src/pages/virus-removal-service.astro:467
6. src/pages/locations/tarrant-county/arlington.astro:463
7. src/pages/locations/tarrant-county/burleson.astro:203
8. src/pages/locations/kaufman-county/terrell.astro:317
9. src/pages/locations/tarrant-county/bedford.astro:203
10. src/pages/locations/tarrant-county/benbrook.astro:203
[... 87 more location files ...]

## VALIDATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Test structured data after fixes
# Use Google Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

# Check for duplicate ratings in code
grep -r "aggregateRating" src/

# Validate individual page
# Paste page URL into: https://validator.schema.org/
```

## PREVENTION STRATEGIES

1. **Build-Time Validation**: Add schema validation to build process
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Never put aggregateRating in Layout.astro
3. **Page-Specific Ratings**: Each service/location page manages its own rating
4. **Regular Audits**: Weekly Google Search Console structured data report checks
5. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines in CLAUDE.md about schema rules
